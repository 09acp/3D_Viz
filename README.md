#### __Notebooks__
-  : template notebook
-  
-  

#### __Stage 1__
- [ ] Data Wrangling
  - [x] Identify dataset
    - Wharton Fundamental Data
  - [x] EDA 1 - missing data
  - [x] Create Date Index
  - [ ]
  - [ ] Pivot Table    

  - [ ] Clean dataset
  - [ ] Check for duplicates

  - [ ] Save as sqlite database


#### __Stage 2__
- [ ] PCA
- [ ] Research Stock Clustering
  - [ ] Dependent Variable/s


#### __Stage 3__
- [ ] DASH Visualization
  - [ ] Python
  - [ ] R

#### __Issues__
- The reporting frequency is not daily ( probably quarterly ). Each date (daily) should have values for all companies ( must be subsampled ?).
  - order by unique year-quarter
- Pivoting portfolio of stocks with multiple features. Multi-Index df. How to cluster high dimensional data ?
  -


#### Additional Ideas
- Use classification model to highlight Predicted Classes for specific period
  (Manual evaluation)
    - Will likely use price data model
